# Advent of code 2017

[[**Open the notebook in Colab**]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hhoppe/advent_of_code/blob/main/2017/advent_of_code_2017.ipynb)

IPython/Jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/hhoppe/advent_of_code/blob/main/2017/advent_of_code_2017.ipynb) by [Hugues Hoppe](http://hhoppe.com/) with solutions to the [2017 Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2017).
Completed in November 2022.

In this notebook, I explore both "compact" and "fast" code versions, along with data visualizations.

I was able to speed up all the solutions such that the [cumulative time](#timings) across all 25 puzzles is about 2 s.
(For some puzzles, I had to resort to the `numba` package to jit-compile Python functions.)

Here are some visualization results:
